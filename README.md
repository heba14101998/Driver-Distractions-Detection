# Driver-Distractions-Detection
This presents a method for driver distraction detection and evaluation while performing a secondary task. The detection is executed by the deep learning algorithm based on the CNN architecture. Therefore, the method is capable not only to detect driver behavior, but also alert the driver and using a touch screen to display data regarding the driver's performance while driving on the current day, as well as those taken in the previous days. The driver can also control the device by temporarily or permanently turning it on or off.
